# Sampling-Assignment-102103145
Sampling is a strategy employed to understand a population by studying statistics from a representative subset, eliminating the necessity to examine each individual. To address the initial imbalance in the dataset, which consisted of 763 non-fraudulent cases and only 9 fraudulent cases, an oversampling method was applied. This involved generating additional instances of the minority class (fraudulent cases) to align with the majority class (non-fraudulent cases), resulting in a balanced dataset consolidated into a unified data frame.

The following sampling methods were applied:

1. Simple Random Sampling: Randomly selecting samples from the population.

2. Systematic Sampling: Choosing samples at regular intervals after a random start.

3. Cluster Sampling: Randomly selecting clusters from the population.

4. Stratified Sampling: Dividing the population into subgroups based on specific criteria.

5. Bootstrap Sampling: Resampling with replacement to create multiple samples from the original dataset.

The result is stored the file [sampling_results.csv](https://github.com/gandhi25samar/Sampling-Assignment-102103145/files/14151275/sampling_results.csv)

## The RANDOM FOREST outperformed all other models when applied to Bootstrap Sampling Technique.
